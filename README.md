# ICharacterSeq Interface

Character Sequence

## Definition

An object to help you iterate over the characters that make up a text or `string` value.

By characters, we mean logical characters, rather than `char` values. Multi-byte characters (such as characters from Asian scripts, dead languages, and emoji) are treated as one single atomic unit. (That's why we represent individual characters as `string` values and not `char`s.)

To get an instance of an `ICharacterSeq`, use the static class `CharacterSeq`'s `OfText` method.

An `ICharacterSeq` value's `Length` is the number of characters you might expect to find when you look at its graphical representation, rather than the number of `char` values it contains.

`ICharacterSeq` values of the same text compare as equal with the `Equals` method.

And when you create an `ICharacterSeq` of a string, the sequence will store only a normalized representation of the text, with combining diacritics fused into a single logical character. (See `String.Normalize()` in the .NET documentation.)

You can create an `ICharacterSeq` of the empty string. That is a special case, and it is the only  `ICharacterSeq` whose `IsEmpty` property will be set to `true`.

You can use the `Head` and `Tail` properties to iterate over the sequence of characters in a recursive functional style, in the way you might treat a linked list. You will know you have reached the end of the sequence when the current sequence (eg, the `Tail` of the previous iteration's sequence) has `IsEmpty` set to `true`. 

```c#
public interface ICharacterSeq : IEnumerable<string>
```

## Examples

```c#
string message = "üëÅÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüêë";
message.Length // => 4
message[ 0 ] // => '\ud83d' (Unprintable)

ICharacterSeq msgSeq = CharacterSeq.OfText( message );
msgSeq.Length // => 3
msgSeq[ 1 ] // => "‚ù§Ô∏è"
msgSeq.Head // => "üëÅÔ∏è"
msgSeq.Tail // => "‚ù§Ô∏èüêë"
msgSeq.Filter( ( string ch ) => ch == "‚ù§Ô∏è" ); // => "‚ù§Ô∏è"
msgSeq.Map(
    ( string ch ) =>
    {
        if ( ch == "üëÅÔ∏è" )
            return "I ";
        else if ( ch == "üêë" )
            return " you";
    }
); // => "I ‚ù§Ô∏è you"
```

## Instance Properties

### `Head` *string*

Returns the first character in the sequence.

The `Head` and `Tail` properties are designed to help you iterate over the text in a recursive functional style, if that is your preference.

###  `IsEmpty` *bool*

If this property is true, it means the sequence contains no characters. Calling `Head` or `ToString()` on an empty sequence will return the empty `string`.

Calling `Tail` on an empty sequence will return the same empty sequence.

### `Length` *int*

Returns the number of logical characters in the sequence.

Remember that this is different from `string.Length`, which returns the number of `char` values contained in the `string`.

Because .NET uses the UTF-16 to represent text internally, some characters can be made up of more than one `char` value. And that fact is actually the primary motivation for providing this interface as a way of working with logical characters, rather than `char`s, which may only represent a partial character.

### `Tail` *ICharacterSeq*

Returns an `ICharacterSeq` containing all characters in the original sequence, except for the first.

The `Head` and `Tail` properties are designed to help you iterate over the text in a recursive functional style, if that is your preference.

If the `Tail` property of a sequence has its `IsEmpty` property set to `true`, that means you have reached the end of the sequence and there are no more characters.

If you call `Tail` on an already empty sequence, you get back the same empty sequence.

## Instance Methods

### *indexer*

You can use bracket notation to retrieve individual characters. This works in the same way as the `CharacterAt` method.

#### Example
```c#
ICharacterSeq msgSeq = CharacterSeq.OfText( "üëÅÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüêë" );

msgSeq[ 1 ]; // => "‚ù§Ô∏è"
```

### CharacterAt

```c#
public string CharacterAt( int index );
```

Retrieves the logical character at the specified index.

This will be a whole character, not one part of a UTF-16 surrogate pair.

The index is zero-based, but it refers to whole logical characters, rather than `char` values, which may only be part of a unicode surrogate pair.

#### Example
```c#
string message = "üëÅÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüêë";
message.Length; // => 4
message[ 0 ]; // => '\ud83d'

ICharacterSeq msgSeq = CharacterSeq.OfText( message );
msgSeq.Length; // => 3
msgSeq[ 0 ]; // => "üëÅÔ∏è"
```

### Equals

```c#
public override bool Equals( object? obj );
```

Determines whether the other is an `ICharacterSeq` containing the same value as the current `ICharacterSeq`.

`ICharacterSeq` values containing equivalent `string` values should compare as equal.

However, please note that an `ICharacterSeq` stores a normalized internal representation of its text value. (See `string.Normalize()` in the .NET documentation.)

That means that if you create two sequences containing the same logical characters, but one where they were created using whole characters, and another where they were creating using combinators, then the two sequences will compare as equal. (Even though the equivalent `string`s will not.)

### Filter

```c#
public ICharacterSeq Filter( Func<string, bool> condition );
```

Alows you to define a function that takes a single `string` as an argument and returns a `bool` value.

`Filter` will call the function against each logical character that it contains, and return a new `ICharacterSeq` containing only those characters for which your function returned `true`.

#### Example
```c#
ICharacterSeq example = CharacterSeq.OfText( "The Lady\nFrom Shanghai" );

example.Filter(
    ( string item ) => item != "\n"
).ToString() // => "The LadyFrom Shanghai"
```

### GetEnumerator

```c#
public IEnumerator<string> GetEnumerator();
```

Allows you to iterate over the characters of an `ICharacterSeq` with a `foreach` statement.

### GetHashCode

```c#
public override int GetHashCode();
```

The hashcode produced will be the same as the hashcode of the `string` that the `ICharacterSeq` contains.

### Map

```c#
public ICharacterSeq Map( Func<string, string> transformation );
```

Allows you to provide a transformation function, which will be called on each character in sequence.

This function must return a `string`.

The results of calling the function on each of the sequence's characters will be combined into one text value, which will be returned as another `ICharacterSeq`.

#### Example
```c#
ICharacterSeq msgSeq = CharacterSeq.OfText( "üëÅÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüêë" );

msgSeq.Map(
    ( string ch ) =>
    {
        if ( ch == "üëÅÔ∏è" )
            return "I ";
        else if ( ch == "üêë" )
            return " you";
    }
); // => "I ‚ù§Ô∏è you"
```

### ToString

```c#
public override string ToString();
```

Returns the text value that this `ICharacterSeq` represents as a `string`.

Usually this is the same text value from which the sequence was originally made, but remember that it might not match exactly because any composite characters will have been normalized. (See `string.Normalize()` in the .NET documentation.)

# Characters Class

## Definition

Contains constants and methods useful for manipulating the characters within text values.

A text value is a `string`, but it is also a sequence of characters.

C# must use multiple `char` values to represent certain Unicode characters, such as many Asian scripts and also, of course, emoji.

But when we manipulate characters, we don't want to have to deal with that complexity. It would be better if we could treat each character as a single atomic unit.

In order to make that possible, this library represents characters as `string`s, rather than as `char`s.

```c#
public static class Characters
```

## Fields

### `Blanks` *Static Class*

Contains constants representing all of the spacing modifier characters that are not line breaks.

| Field | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `EmQuad` | A space the width of one em. Equivalent to `EmSpace`, which is usually preferred over use of this character. |
| `EmSpace` | A space the width of one em. |
| `EnQuad` | A space the width of one en. Equivalent to `EnSpace`, which is usually preferred over use of this character. |
| `EnSpace` | A space the width of one en. |
| `FigureSpace` | A space equivalent to the width of a digit, in fonts that use monospaced characters to represent digits. |
| `HairSpace` | Even thinner than a `ThinSpace`. |
| `IdeographicSpace` | A space as wide as a Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (CJK) character cell. |
| `MediumMathematicalSpace` | A space that is four eighteenths of an em wide that is often used in mathematical formulae. |
| `MidSpace` | A space one fourth of an em wide, slightly narrower than a `ThickSpace`. |
| `NarrowNoBreakSpace` | A space about the width of a `ThinSpace`. However, no line breaks are permitted to replace this character. |
| `NonBreakingSpace` | An ordinary `Space`. However, no line breaks are permitted to replace this character. |
| `PunctuationSpace` | A space as wide as the narrow punctuation characters in a font, such as the comma or the full stop. |
| `SixPerEmSpace` | A space one sixth of an em wide. |
| `Space` | The usual space used between words on a latin script keyboard. |
| `Tab` | A horizontal space whose width can be determined by the user. |
| `ThickSpace` | A space one third of an em wide. |
| `ThinSpace` | A space one fifth to one sixth of an em wide, recommended for use as a thousands separator. |
| `ZeroWidthNoBreakSpace` | According to Unicode, this is not technically a spacing character, but we are leaving it in the list because the ECMAScript standard classifies it as one. |
| `Set` | *ISet\<string\>* The set of all of the spacing modifier characters listed above. |

### `LineEndings` *Static Class*

Contains constants representing line breaks and line terminators.

| Field | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `CarriageReturn` | The signal to return the carriage of a typewriter or printer to its starting horizontal position. It is used as the first character of the line break sequence preferred by Windows. It was also the line break character used by MacOS versions before the first in the OS X series. |
| `FormFeed` | A signal for printers to skip to the end of the form or page. |
| `LineFeed` | A signal for printers to skip to the next line. It is used as the preferred line break character for Unix and Linux-derived systems, and it is the second character in the Windows preferred line break sequence. |
| `LineSeparator` | Indicates that the line has ended. |
| `NextLine` | A signal for printers to skip to the next line. |
| `ParagraphSeparator` | Indicates that the paragraph has ended. |
| `VerticalTab` | A vertical space whose width can be determined by the user. |
| `Unix` | The line ending used by Unix and Linux-derived systems. The same as the `LineFeed`. |
| `Windows` | The line ending preferred by Windows systems. It consists of a `CarriageReturn` followed by a `LineFeed`. Sometimes referred to as `\r\n` or `CrLf`. |
| `Set` | *ISet\<string\>* The set of all of the line ending characters listed above. |

`Spaces` *ISet\<String\>*

The super-set of all spacing modifiers, which is the union of all constants defined in the `Blanks` field and all constants defined in the `LineEndings` field.

## Methods

## CloseShave

```c#
public static string CloseShave( string text )
```

### Definition

This function is similar to `string.Trim()`, but the range of characters it removes is broader.

This function removes all characters included in the `Spaces` set from both the beginning and end of a text value.

The spacing characters "within" the text are left intact, but we guarantee that neither the beginning nor the end of the text value will be a spacing character.

_Please note that this method relies on_ `CharacterSeq` _internally, meaning it has the side-effect of normalizing the output. (See_ `string.Normalize()` _in the .NET documentation.)_

## CloseShaveEnd

```c#
public static string CloseShaveEnd( string text )
```

### Definition

This function is similar to `string.TrimRight()`, but the range of characters it removes is broader.

This function removes all characters included in the `Spaces` set from the end of a text value, meaning its final character will not be a spacing character.

_Please note that this method relies on_ `CharacterSeq` _internally, meaning it has the side-effect of normalizing the output. (See_ `string.Normalize()` _in the .NET documentation.)_

## CloseShaveStart

```c#
public static string CloseShaveStart( string text )
```

### Definition

This function is similar to `string.TrimLeft()`, but the range of characters it removes is broader.

This function removes all characters included in the `Spaces` set from the beginning of a text value, meaning its initial character will not be a spacing character.

_Please note that this method relies on_ `CharacterSeq` _internally, meaning it has the side-effect of normalizing the output. (See_ `string.Normalize()` _in the .NET documentation.)_

## NormalizeLineEndings

```c#
public static string NormalizeLineEndings( string text )
```

### Definition

Replaces all line ending character sequences in a text value with the standard Unix line feed character. (Unicode 10 / Hex `000a`.)

## WindowsLineEndings

```c#
public static string WindowsLineEndings( string text )
```

### Definition

Replaces all line ending character sequences in a text value with the standard Microsoft Windows sequence of carriage return (Unicode 13 / Hex `000d`) + line feed (Unicode 10 / Hex `000a`).

---

# CharacterSeq Class

## Definition

```c#
public static class CharacterSeq
```

Provides static methods to create `ICharacterSeq` objects.

## Static Properties

### `Empty` *ICharacterSeq*

```c#
public static ICharacterSeq Empty
```

Returns the empty character sequence, containing no characters.

## Static Methods

## OfText

```c#
public static ICharacterSeq OfText( string text )
```

### Definition

Constructs a character sequence from the provided text argument.

(Remember that any `string` values containing composite characters will be normalized.)

---

# NameKey Class

## Definition

```c#
public class NameKey : IEquatable<NameKey>
```

A `NameKey` is intended to be an identifier for something that is both unique and meaningful.

It takes the form of a number of text segments (names) separated by the slash character, like this: `category/sub-category/local-name`

If this reminds you of a `namespace`, that is not a coincidence.

The individual name segments may contain spaces, but spacing characters at the beginning or end will be removed. Name segments may not contain line end characters. And any non-printable control characters will also be removed.

Each `NameKey` has a `TextValue` property, which is considered to be its canonical representation. `NameKey`s with the same `TextValue` compare as equal. `NameKey`s are case-sensitive, just like `string` values. However, name segment values will be normalized. (See `string.Normalize()` in the .NET documentation.)

Each `NameKey` has properties called `Context` and `LeafName`. Its `Context` is another `NameKey` made up of all the name segments that come before the final one. And `LeafName` is the `string` representation of the final name. Therefore, in the `NameKey` value `"local/languages/French"`, the `Context` is the `NameKey` of `"local/languages"` anf the `LeafName` is the `string` `"French"`.

If a `NameKey` is composed of only one name segment, it does not have a `Context`, and attempting to access its `Context` will throw an `InvalidOperationException`. In order to avoid this exception, you can check its `HasContext` property. Conversely, the `IsRoot` property will return `true` for `NameKey` values with only a single name segment. 

A sequence of names separated by slashes may remind you of a Unix-style file path. However, `NameKey`s are not permitted to begin with a slash. Also, note that in `NameKey`s, the slash cannot be escaped by a backslash character.

`NameKey`s are effectively immutable. Once one is created, it cannot be altered.

## Constructor

```c#
public NameKey( params string[] names )
```

You can pass in any number of names, subject to the rules described above.

If any segment contains a slash, it will be parsed as two names.

### Example

```c#
// The following NameKeys are equivalent:

NameKey example1 = new NameKey( "local", "languages", "French" );
// => NameKey { local/languages/French }

NameKey example2 = new NameKey( "local/languages", "French" );
// => NameKey { local/languages/French }

NameKey example3 = new NameKey( "local/languages/French" );
// => NameKey { local/languages/French }
```

## Instance Properties

## Context

```c#
public NameKey Context
```

Returns the `NameKey` of all name segments that come before the final segment. (The `LeafName`.)

### Example

```c#
NameKey spumoni = new NameKey( "desserts/spumoni" );

spumoni.IsRoot; // => false
spumoni.HasContext; // => true
spumoni.Context; // => NameKey { desserts }
spumoni.LeafName; // => "spumoni"

// You cannot access the Context of the root name:
NameKey menu = spumoni.Context;

menu.IsRoot; // => true
menu.HasContext; // => false
menu.Context; // => InvalidOperationException
```

## HasContext

```c#
public bool HasContext
```

Returns `true` if this is a `NameKey` made up of multiple name segments. (Any segments preceding the final `LeafName` are the name's `Context`.)

### Example

```c#
NameKey dailySpecial = new NameKey( "specials/Pescado Veracruz" );
NameKey menuSection = dailySpecial.Context;

dailySpecial.HasContext; // => true

menuSection.TextValue; // => "specials"
menuSection.IsRoot; // => true
menuSection.TextValue == menuSection.LeafName; // => true
menuSection.HasContext; // => false
```

## IsRoot

```c#
public bool IsRoot
```

If a `NameKey` is the root name, it means it is made up of only a single name and does not have a `Context` property.

### Example

```c#
NameKey dailySpecial = new NameKey( "specials/Pescado Veracruz" );
NameKey menuSection = dailySpecial.Context;

dailySpecial.IsRoot; // => false

menuSection.IsRoot; // => true
menuSection.TextValue == menuSection.LeafName; // => true
menuSection.TextValue; // => "specials"
menuSection.HasContext; // => false
menuSection.Context; // => InvalidOperationException
```

## LeafName

```c#
public string LeafName
```

Returns the text value of the final name in the sequence that makes up the `NameKey`.

### Example

```c#
NameKey myUser = new NameKey( "users/me" );

myUser.LeafName; // => "me"

NameKey justMe = new NameKey( "me" );

justMe.IsRoot; // => true
justMe.HasContext // => false
justMe.LeafName; // => "me"
justMe.LeafName == justMe.TextValue; // => true
```

## NameSeq

```c#
public List<string> NameSeq
```

Returns the sequence of names that make up the `NameKey` as a `List` of `string` values.

### Example

```c#
NameKey myColour = new NameKey( "user/colours/Ultramarine" );

myColour.NameSeq[ 0 ]; // => "user"
myColour.NameSeq[ 1 ]; // => "colours"
myColour.NameSeq[ 2 ]; // => "Ultramarine"
```

## TextValue

```c#
public string TextValue
```

Returns the canonical text representation of the `NameKey`, which is a single `string` value where each segment is separated from the next by a slash character. (`"/"`)

### Example

```c#
NameKey song = new NameKey(
    "music",
    "folk",
    "20th Century",
    "Doo-Wop",
    "Only You"
);

song.TextValue; // => "music/folk/20th Century/Doo-Wop/Only You"
```

## Instance Methods

## Append

```c#
public NameKey Append( string childName )
```

Given a `childName` argument, this function returns a new `NameKey` whose `.Context` is the current `NameKey`, and whose `.LeafName` is the provided `childName`. 

### Example

```c#
NameKey category = new NameKey( "films/mystery" );

category.Append( "Vertigo" ); // => NameKey { films/mystery/Vertigo }
```

## Concat

```c#
public NameKey Concat( NameKey suffixNameKey )
```

Combines the current `NameKey` and a `suffixNameKey` to form a new `NameKey` with the entire name sequence of the suffix appended to the name sequence of the current `NameKey`.

### Example

```c#
NameKey prefix = new NameKey( "user/lists/street type" );
NameKey suffix = new NameKey( "items/Avenue" );

prefix.Concat( suffix ); // => NameKey { user/lists/street type/items/Avenue }
```

## Equals

```c#
public override bool Equals( object? obj )
```

Determines whether two object instances are equivalent.

Two `NameKey` values are judged to be equivalent if their `TextValue` properties are equivalent.

This comparison works exactly like `string` comparison, and it is therefore case-sensitive.

However, please note that `NameKey`s normalize the text value of each name segement, so that even if the text is entered using combining diacritic characters, `NameKey` segments will store only the resulting canonical Unicode character, and therefore some `string`s that are strictly different will result in the same `NameKey` value. (See `string.Normalize()` in the .NET documentation.)

### Example

```c#
new NameKey( "local/languages/Klingon" ).Equals(
    new NameKey( "local", "languages", "Klingon" )
); // => true

// However, note the case-sensitivity:
new NameKey( "local/languages/Klingon" ).Equals(
    new NameKey( "local", "languages", "klingon" )
); // => false

// String normalization means that some differently-produced name segments will
// result in identical NameKeys:
new NameKey( "local/languages/franc\u0327ais" ).Equals(
    new NameKey( "local/languages/fran\u00e7ais" )
); // => true
```

## GetHashCode

```c#
public override int GetHashCode()
```

Effectively, this method returns the same hash value as the `NameKey`'s `TextValue`.

## ToString

```c#
public override string ToString()
```

Returns a value combining the type name (`NameKey`) with the instance's `TextValue`.

## Example

```c#
new NameKey( "system/settings/screenWidth" ).ToString();
// => "NameKey { system/settings/screenWidth }"
```
